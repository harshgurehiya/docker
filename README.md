## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

This repository covers the process of containerizing frontend, backend, and database applications built with diverse tech stacks like React.js, Next.js or any Vite projects. 
Additionally, it covers examples of the containerization of complete full-stack applications, including MERN setups. 

It also contains the corresponding code for all these dockerized applications using the latest Docker features, including docker-compose watch and init.

## <a name="quick-start">🤸 Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

For a few specific applications, we require environment variables. I've included a sample .env.example file for these essential projects. 
However, one crucial element needed for these projects is,

```env
DB_URL=
```

For full stack applications, we'll be using MongoDB as a database. So do create an account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) as well as 
install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) for creating local database instance for the project. 

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.
